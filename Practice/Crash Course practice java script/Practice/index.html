            <h2>My intro</h2>
            <p> Hello my name is Syed Mustafa Imam, I am currently enrolled in my 5th semester of Bachelors of Computer Science with CGPA 3.87 from SZABIST Karachi, Pakistan. I have also completed my Artificial Intelligence nano degree from Udacity and Deep
                Neural Network specialization from deeplearing.ai by Andrew Ng. Along with that, I am also studying Machine learning from Stanford University. Being an aspiring Computer Scientist, I am always ingeniously looking to solve real-world problems
                using Artificial Intelligence, IoT & Mixed Reality using Microsoft HoloLens. </p>
            <br>

            <p id="subintro">Recently I have participated in #BuildwithAI Global Hackaton by Hackmakers, in which I got 4th position among 75+ countries and 4,000+ total competitors around the world. I am also a highly creative and multi-talented Graphic Designer and
                Web Developer with vast experience in multimedia, marketing, and print design.</p>
