    <div id='about'>
        I am currently enrolled in my 6th semester of Bachelors of Computer Science with CGPA 3.89 from SZABIST Karachi,
        Pakistan. I have also completed my Artificial Intelligence nano degree from Udacity and Deep Neural Network
        specialization from deeplearing.ai by Andrew Ng. Along with that, I am also studying Machine learning from
        Stanford University.


        Being an aspiring Computer Scientist, I am always ingeniously looking to solve real-world problems using
        Artificial Intelligence, IoT & Mixed Reality using Microsoft HoloLens. Recently I have participated in
        #BuildwithAI Global Hackaton by Hackmakers, in which I got 4th position among 75+ countries and 4,000+ total
        competitors around the world.
