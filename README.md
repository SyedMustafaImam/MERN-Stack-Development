### Description
<p>This web application is developed using Node, Express, and MongoDB along with this I have used EJS with jQuery and AJAX to enable in-page data loading, so we do not have to reload the page to view the changes made in the database. In which I have made the complete CRUD operations on the student data, by using HTTP verbs. SMI in this application the student can only edit the records, whereas the teacher can add new students, delete students and update students.</p>
